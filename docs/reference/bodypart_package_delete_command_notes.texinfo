The command that deletes a package from the system when appended with
the package reference identifier specified by
@code{package_name_convention}.


Package managers generally expect the name of a package to be passed
as a parameter. However, in some cases we do not need to pass the name
of a particular package to the command. Ending the command string with
@samp{$} prevents CFEngine from appending the package name to the
string.

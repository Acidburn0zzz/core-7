If set to @code{start}, CFEngine Nova will keep the service in a running state,
while @code{stop} means that the service is kept in a stopped state.
@code{disable} implies @code{stop}, and ensures that the service can not be
started directly, but needs to be enabled somehow first (e.g. by changing 
file permissions).

Use this as an alternative to auditing to use the syslog mechanism to centralize
or manage messaging from CFEngine. A backup of these messages will still be
kept in @file{WORKDIR/outputs} if you are using @code{cf-execd}.

On native Windows version of CFEngine (Nova or above), using
@samp{verbose} will include a message when the promise is kept or
repaired in the event log.

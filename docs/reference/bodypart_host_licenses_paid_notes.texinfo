Licensees of the commercial CFEngine releases have to make a promise
in acceptance of contract terms by setting this value to the number of licenses
they have paid for. This is tallied with the number of licenses granted.
This declaration should be placed in all separate configuration files, e.g.
@file{failsafe.cf}, @file{promises.cf}.

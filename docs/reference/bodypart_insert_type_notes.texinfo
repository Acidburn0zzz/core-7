The default is to treat the promiser as a literal string of convergent
lines (the values @code{literal} and @code{string} are synonymonous).

The value @code{file} is used to tell CFEngine that the string is non-literal
and should be interpreted as a filename from which to import lines, see
@ref{insert_select in insert_lines, ,insert_select}

The default behaviour assumes that multi-line entries are not ordered
specifically, and should be treated as a collection of lines of text
and not as a single unbroken object.
If the option @samp{preserve_block} is used, then CFEngine will not
break up multiple lines into individual, non-ordered objects, so that
the block of text will be preserved. However, due to convergence
constraints, if all the lines exist at the start, CFEngine will not
see the need to add any new text. If any one of the lines is missing
from the block, then the whole block will be added as a single entity.
(This is the only way to achieve convergent behaviour in block editing.)

@end example
@end cartouche

This function returns the name of a ost that may be considered the
leader of a group of peers of the current host. Peers are defined
according to a list of hosts, provided as a file in the first
argument. This file should contain a list (one per line), possibly
with comments, of fully qualified host names. CFEngine breaks up this
list into non-overlapping groups of up to @var{groupsize}, each of
which has a leader which is the first host in the group.

The current host should belong to this file if it is expected to interact
with the others. The function returns nothing if the host does not belong
to the list.

@noindent @b{ARGUMENTS}:

@table @samp
@item File of hosts
A path to a list of hosts.

@item Comment pattern
A pattern that matches a legal comment in the file. The regex may 
match a partial line (that is, it is unanchored, @pxref{Anchored vs. unanchored regular expressions}).
Comments are stripped as the file is read.

@item Group size
A number between 2 and 64 which represents the number of peers in a peer-group.
An arbitary limit of 64 is set on groups to avoid nonsensical promises.

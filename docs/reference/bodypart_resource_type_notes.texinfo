By default, access to resources granted by the server are
files. However, sometimes it is useful to cache @code{literal}
strings, hints and data in the server, e.g. the contents of variables,
hashed passwords etc for easy access. In the case of literal data, the
promise handle serves as the reference identifier for queries. Queries
are instigated by function calls by any agent.

The term @code{query} may also be used in commercial versions of
CFEngine to query the server for data from embedded databases. This is
currently for internal use only, and is used to grant access to report
`menus'.

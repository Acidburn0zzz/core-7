@table @samp
@item scalar
A single value, with compressed statistics is retained.  The value of the
data is not expected to change much for the lifetime of the daemon (and so
will be sampled less often by @samp{cf-monitord}).

@item static
A synonym for `scalar'.

@item log
The measured value is logged as an infinite time-series in
@samp{$(sys.workdir)/state}.

@item weekly
A standard CFEngine two-dimensional time average (over a weekly period) is retained.

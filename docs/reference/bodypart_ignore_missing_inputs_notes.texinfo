The inputs lists determines which files are parsed by CFEngine. Normally
stringent security checks are made on input files to prevent abuse of the
system by unauthorized users. Sometimes however, it is appropriate to consider
the automatic plug-in of modules that might or might not exist. This option
permits CFEngine to list possible files that might not exist and continue
`best effort' with those that do exist. The default of all Booleans is false,
so the normal behaviour is to signal an error if an input is not found.

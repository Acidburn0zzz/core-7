CSV files are easy to generate in CFEngine from individual promise logging functions.
XML is not easily generated due to its hierarchical structure. This function allows
@code{cf-report} to convert a CSV file into pidgin XML for convenience. The schema
has the general form:

@verbatim

<output>
 <line> <one>...</one> <two>...</two> ... </line>
 <line> <one>...</one> <two>...</two> ... </line>
</output>

@end verbatim

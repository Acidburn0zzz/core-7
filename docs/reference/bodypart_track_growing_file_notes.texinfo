This option applies only to file based input streams. If this is
@samp{true}, CFEngine treats the file as if it were a log file,
growing continuously. Thus the monitor reads all new entries since the
last sampling time on each invocation. In this way, the monitor does
not count lines in the log file redundantly.

This makes a log pattern promise equivalent to something like
@samp{tail -f logfile | grep pattern} in Unix parlance.

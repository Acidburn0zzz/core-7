System variables are derived from CFEngine's automated discovery of system values.
They are provided as variables in order to make automatically adaptive rules for
configuration, e.g.

@verbatim

files:

 any::

  "$(sys.resolv)"

      create        => "true",
      edit_line     => doresolv("@(this.list1)","@(this.list2)"),
      edit_defaults => reconstruct;

@end verbatim

@noindent The above rule requires no class specification because the
variable itself is class-specific.

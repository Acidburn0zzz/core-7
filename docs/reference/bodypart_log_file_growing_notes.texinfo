If true, CFEngine behaves like @samp{tail -f}, sampling the recent
entries in the file relative to the last measurement. If the file size
is less than the position remembered at the end of the last
measurement, @code{cf-monitord} assumes that the file has been
truncated and starts again from the beginning.

The location of the CFEngine work directory and cache. For the
system privileged user this is normally:

@verbatim

# workdir = /var/cfengine

@end verbatim

For non-privileged users it is in the user's home directory:

@verbatim

# workdir = /home/user/.cfagent

@end verbatim

On the Windows version of CFEngine Nova, it is normally under program
files (the directory name may change with the language of Windows):

@verbatim

# workdir = C:\Program Files\CFEngine

@end verbatim

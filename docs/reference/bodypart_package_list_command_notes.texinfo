This command should provide a complete list of the packages installed
on the system.  It might also list packages that are not
installed. Those should be filtered out using the
@code{package_installed_regex}.


Package managers generally expect the name of a package to be passed as a parameter. However, in some cases
we do not need to pass the name of a particular package to the command. Ending the command string with @samp{$}
prevents CFEngine from appending the package name to the string.

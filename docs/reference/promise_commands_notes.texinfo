NOTE: when referring to executables whose paths contain spaces, you
should quote the entire program string separately so that CFEngine
knows the name of the executable file. e.g.

@smallexample

 commands:

  windows::

   "\"c:\Program Files\my name with space\" arg1 arg2";

  linux::

   "\"/usr/bin/funny command name\" -a -b -c";

@end smallexample

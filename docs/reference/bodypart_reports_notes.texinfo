A list of report types that can be generated by this agent.  The
listed items from @code{compliance} onward are available only
Enterprise editions of CFEngine.

The keyword @samp{all} can be used to get all reports except the audit
and locking reports. The latter are large and unwieldy and need specific confirmation.

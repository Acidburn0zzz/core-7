This overrides the global settings. Promises which take a long time to
verify should usually be protected with a long value for this
parameter.  This serves as a resource `spam' protection. A CFEngine

operations are not performed on every run. Using time classes like
@code{Hr12} etc., is one part of this strategy; using @code{ifelapsed}
is another which is not tied to a specific time.

When editing binary files, it can be dangerous to replace a text
string with one that is longer or shorter as byte references and jumps
would be destroyed. CFEngine will therefore not allow replacements that
are larger in size than the original, but shorter strings can be padded
out to the same length.

@noindent @b{Default value}:@*

The @code{binarypaddingchar} defaults to the empty string (i.e., no padding)

This was previous called `recurse' in earlier versions of CFEngine.
Note that the value @samp{inf} may be used for an unlimited value.

When searching recursively from a directory, the parent directory is
not part of the search. It is only the anchor point. To alter the parent,
a separate non-recursive promise should be made.

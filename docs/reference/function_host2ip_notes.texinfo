Uses whatever configured name service is used by the resolver library
to translate a hostname into an IP address. It will return an IPv6
address by preference if such an address exists. This function uses
the standard lookup procedure for a name, so it mimics internal
processes and can therefore be used not only to cache multiple lookups
in the configuration, but to debug the behaviour of the resolver.

@b{History}: This function was introduced in CFEngine version 3.0.4 (2010)

The numbering of fields is a matter for consistency and convention.
Arrays are usually thought to start with first index equal to zero (0),
but the first column in a file would normally be 1. By setting this option,
you can tell CFEngine that the first column should be understood as number 0
instead, for consistency with other array functions.

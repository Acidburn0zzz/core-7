If a user specifies a field that does not exist, because there are not
so many fields, this allows the number of fields to be extended.
Without this setting, CFEngine will issue an error if a non-existent field
is referenced.
Blank fields in a tabular file can be eliminated or kept depending
in this setting. If in doubt, set this to true.

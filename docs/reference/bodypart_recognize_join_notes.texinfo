If set to true, this option allows CFEngine to process line based files
with backslash continuation. The default is to not process continuation backslashes.

Back slash lines will only be concatenated if the file requires editing,
and will not be restored. Restoration of the backslashes is not
possible in a meaningful and convergent fashion.

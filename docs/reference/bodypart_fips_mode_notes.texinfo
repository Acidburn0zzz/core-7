Appears as of Nova 2.0.
If CFEngine commercial editions this value may be set to avoid the use
of old deprecated algorithms that are no longer FIPS 140-2 compliant. 
If not set, there is some degree of compatibility with older versions and
algorithms. During an upgrade, setting this parameter can cause a lot of
recomputation of checksums etc. Government bodies starting with Nova 2.0
or higher should set this to @samp{true} from the start.
